The following parameters are configurable for the API Client:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
| http_client_instance | `Union[Session, HttpClientProvider]` | The Http Client passed from the sdk user for making requests |
| override_http_client_configuration | `bool` | The value which determines to override properties of the passed Http Client from the sdk user |
| http_call_back | `HttpCallBack` | The callback value that is invoked before and after an HTTP call is made to an endpoint |
| timeout | `float` | The value to use for connection timeout. <br> **Default: 60** |
| max_retries | `int` | The number of times to retry an endpoint call if it fails. <br> **Default: 0** |
| backoff_factor | `float` | A backoff factor to apply between attempts after the second try. <br> **Default: 2** |
| retry_statuses | `Array of int` | The http statuses on which retry is to be done. <br> **Default: [408, 413, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504, 521, 522, 524]** |

The API client can be initialized as follows:

### Code-Based Client Initialization

```python
from apimaticcalculator.apimaticcalculator_client import ApimaticcalculatorClient
from apimaticcalculator.configuration import Environment

client = ApimaticcalculatorClient(
    environment=Environment.PRODUCTION
)
```

### Environment-Based Client Initialization

```python
from apimaticcalculator.apimaticcalculator_client import ApimaticcalculatorClient

# Specify the path to your .env file if it’s located outside the project’s root directory.
client = ApimaticcalculatorClient.from_environment(dotenv_path='/path/to/.env')
```

See the [Environment-Based Client Initialization](https://www.github.com/WasifMatic/automated-package-publishing-python-sdk/tree/1.0.16/doc/environment-based-client-initialization.md) section for details.
